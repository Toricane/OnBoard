# Prajwal's Hacker Card

I made an NFC card following the tutorial linked above. It has my name, contact details, and a few components.

price: $28.75
shipping: $25.50
total: $53.75

timeline: 3-5 business days

It was straightforward to follow the tutorial! I didn't have any trouble designing this project.
